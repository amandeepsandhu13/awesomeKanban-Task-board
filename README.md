# task-board
Created a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Used the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with dates.

# Functionality:

When open the task board , on page load it shows the list of prject tasks

Each task is coded as per due date of the task. If task is nearing deadline it has yellow color , overdue tasks will be in red color.
